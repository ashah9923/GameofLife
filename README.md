## Rules of GoL

*   The world is represented by a 2D array (10 x 5)
*	This 2d array should be represented in the CMD/Terminal as a grid
*	Each cell is represented by a “.” for dead and “*” for living
*	Initial state or a seed world will need to be used to kick off the life
*	Your code should use the seed world to generate the next generation
*	Correctly handle cells that start to “go off the board” cells that go off the edge do not get displayed
